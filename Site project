      <h1>Understanding oficial hand signals</h1>
      <p>In volleyball, there are usually 2 officials. The first referee directs the game from the stands, and the second referee stands opposite at the net. A whistle is blown to start and end each game. The referee first signals the error or reason for the end of the game, and then signals which team won the point. This is a compilation of signals by the accompanying hands the whistles</p>
